# Verilog FPGA Pong Game

## Description

A two-player Pong game implemented in Verilog for FPGAs. This project features a VGA display for the game, seven-segment displays for the timer, and dot matrix displays for player scores.

## Features

*   **Two-Player Gameplay:** Compete against a friend in a classic game of Pong.
*   **VGA Display:** The game is displayed on a standard VGA monitor.
*   **Seven-Segment Timer:** A timer on seven-segment displays counts down the game time.
*   **Dot Matrix Scoreboard:** Player scores are shown on two dot matrix displays.
*   **Keypad Control:** Players use a keypad to control their paddles.

## Hardware
